I use langchain and the textloader, feeding League lore into ChatGPT, to produce new stories based off prompts I give it.

### Example
Prompt: Write a concise story about Heimerdinger and Bel'Veth

Output:
Heimerdinger, the brilliant yordle scientist, was known for his insatiable curiosity and desire to uncover the mysteries of the universe. One day, while conducting his experiments in Piltover, he stumbled upon a strange portal that led him to the heart of the Void.

Unbeknownst to Heimerdinger, the portal was created by Bel'Veth, a nightmarish empress who hungered for new experiences and knowledge. Intrigued by Heimerdinger's intellect, Bel'Veth decided to observe him from the shadows.

Heimerdinger, oblivious to the presence of Bel'Veth, became fascinated by the strange landscape of the Void. He started conducting experiments to understand its nature and uncover its secrets. Little did he know that each discovery he made only fueled Bel'Veth's hunger for knowledge.

As Heimerdinger delved deeper into the mysteries of the Void, he began to notice strange occurrences. His inventions and creations started to behave erratically, as if influenced by an external force. Perplexed, he sought answers, unaware that Bel'Veth was slowly infiltrating his mind, twisting his creations to serve her own dark purposes.

One fateful day, Bel'Veth revealed herself to Heimerdinger, her monstrous form towering above him. She offered him unimaginable power and knowledge, promising to fulfill his insatiable curiosity. But Heimerdinger, true to his nature, rejected her offer. He could not betray his principles and let the darkness of the Void consume him.

In a fit of rage, Bel'Veth unleashed her power, attempting to devour Heimerdinger and claim his mind as her own. But Heimerdinger, armed with his intellect and his inventions, fought back. With each explosive blast and ingenious contraption, he pushed back against the nightmarish empress.

Though the encounter with Bel'Veth left Heimerdinger scarred, he emerged from the Void with a newfound understanding of the dangers it held. He dedicated himself to protect

Though the encounter with Bel'Veth left Heimerdinger scarred, he emerged from the Void with a newfound understanding of the dangers it held. He dedicated himself to protecting Runeterra from the corrupting influence of the Void, using his inventions and knowledge to defend against any future threats.

And so, Heimerdinger returned to Piltover, forever changed by his encounter with Bel'Veth. His insatiable curiosity remained, but now tempered with a caution born from the depths of the Void.
